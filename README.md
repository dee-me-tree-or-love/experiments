# Experiments

Hi there, I am repository for various experiments and coding trials.  

## Usage

You can start new project easily using the task [`pyinvoke`](http://www.pyinvoke.org/)  

```bash
invoke new-project <project_name>
git checkout exp-<project_name>
```  
  
This creates a new project branch `exp-<project_name>` and an entry in this README file.   
Fill in more information about the fresh project and you are done!   
Next step is just to check out the new branch and you are good to go :)   
  
## Idea 

This serves as a hub for various projects made for learning purposes. 

| Project | Branch | Language | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| feedparsing | exp-feedparsing | Python | The feedparser experiment to get info from Brainpickings.com RSS feed
| haskell_sandbox | exp-haskell_sandbox |
